## 📖 About

This repository contains my learning projects using **LangChain** on **Groq hardware**.  
LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).  
Here, I explore running LangChain workflows on **Groq accelerators** for faster model execution and efficiency.
